For my milestone project 5 for Code Institute Diploma  in Software development, I have chosen Project Example Idea 1 to build a fitness subscription application. It will be an online fitness and nutrition site. New Dawn provides a platform for people who are into fitness or are looking to get into the world of fitness. In a world in which so much fitness clutter New Dawn will help people who are looking for an easy and simple fitness formula with online subscriptions and a selection of nutrition products. It will be developed using Django which is a high-level Python web framework and deployed using Heroku.

       You may need to update application code to resolve this error.
       Or, you can disable collectstatic for this application:
          $ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1

 !     Push failed
 
Fixed this bug down to an error in my config var file in heroku.

Version Control
-------
       
GitHub and GitPod to update and commit changes to my repository all commits tracked to mark progress
       
-----
Deployment
---
       
Deployed via Heroku. The application was deployed to Heroku very easily. 
A new database is needed for production which is postgress, the SQLite database can be used for development. changes needed to be incorporated in the settings.py file and a secret key was removed and added to the config vars in Heroku. All static files need to be loaded using AWS. A profile and disable static on the site through the terminal allowed deployment to be done.
